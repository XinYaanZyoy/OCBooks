# Brief Overview of CFD

flow problems are not only of fluids but in general sense, and so the CFD.

possible approaches to studying these flows are:
- Experiments (in wind tunnels): They're difficult and expensive to manage more variables at scale
- Theoratical Solutions: it's restricted to only simple geometry, problems in finding Exact or Analytical solutions, Assumptions are made which may not well cater the real world problems.
- Numerical Solutions/CFD: so we use these!

by using CFD we get solutions which may not exist theoratically (i'm skeptic in here!), we can easily change the variables or parameters and get an High Resolution numerical data in SPace and Time.


Typical Steps of CFD:
- define problem and objective
- define the level of aproximation by choosing the right model or equations
- PRE-PROCESSING: domain definition and discretization, Grid Generation.
- FLOW-SOLVER: Stability and Accuracy of the numerical scheme is analyzed and then simulation
- POST-PROCESING: Analysis and validation of results
