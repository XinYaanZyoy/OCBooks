# Governing Equations of Fluid Flow

Governing Equations of Fluid Flow problems often involve PDEs.

[here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ENC6nCxcWn3py25OW-sRe31WkieeIyp/view?usp=sharing) my old tiny note on laplacian in an amusing way!

the way i imagine laplacian is like, for a point on a scalar field, finding a deviation from the average of surrounding or neighbouring points.

derivative of a scalar field is a vec field, and laplacian of this field is again an another scalar field!

laplacian can be imagined as an RHS of linear wave equation;

$$ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t}^2 = v^2 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t}^2 $$


## Laplace Equation
$$ \nabla^2 \phi = 0 $$
