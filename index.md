*NOTE: these notebooks are not meant to teach to anyone, these are just my personal notes, only reason to host it on the internet is a hope! a hope of helping someone who needs it, though these are not rigorous (if science topic) or complete (if other topics) these notes may draw a pattern in reader's mind to be able to learn it somewhere else with ease.*

**THE PURPOSE**
> self written notebooks while either reading or watching something new, helps me learn it by connecting the dots!

these are incomplete and highly ineffective for learning, i use it just to build a kind of vocab, and therefore if you're seeking something complete and rigorous set of subjects, forming a web of all the nodes being various subjects on this planet, checkout my another hosted notebooks collections [Koham](/KoHam)
