i want to rewise/revisualoize the beauty of Wave Equations since i'm beginning my actual journey of CFD with a swayam course, i might need some PDEs, but i think having feelings of Wave Equations might help me boost my confidence while learning CFD.

here's the general linear wave equation

$$ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t}^2 = v^2 \frac{\partial^2{\partial t}^2 $$
