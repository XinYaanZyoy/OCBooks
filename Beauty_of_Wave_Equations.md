[here's](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17ENC6nCxcWn3py25OW-sRe31WkieeIyp/view?usp=sharing) my old tiny note on laplacian in an amusing way!

the way i imagine laplacian is like, for a point on a non changing (or equilibrium) scalar field, finding a deviation from the average of surrounding or neighbouring points. btw all this happen within the domain of definition and the given boundry conditions. boundary conditions might be he steady vals or the rate of flow throught this boundries.

derivative of a scalar field is a vec field, and laplacian of this field is again an another scalar field!


> Equi State Laplace's 
the scalar fields of which the laplacian is null are called harmonic fields or harmonic functions. harmonic functions are smoothest of smoother functions, one can't avg out way more than this!

> Possion

> Evolution Heat
we need 2+ when it started, b.cs may be t depdnt, 

> life wave
overshooting due to a.

if guitar and drum has the same equ, why sounds are different?

What Science will never tell us?

laplacian can be imagined as an RHS of linear wave equation;
$$ \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} = v^2 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} $$

hyperbola 3. whenever there's inertia and a restoring force, and that energy is conserved, this.
parabola 2. if sys is about slow relaxation to a point, this.
ellipse 1. the equilibrium.
possion if there's something that doesn't let it be relaxed.


linear means adding two sols to bring a new sol!
possion is lin as in p+null space eles

matching the boundries is the hard part.

2nd and 3rd are just sol by linear decomposition. like vec space.

1. equilibrium
2. slow convergence to equlib
3. rush to equ with overshoot
