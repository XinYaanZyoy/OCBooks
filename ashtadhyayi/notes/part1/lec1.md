# Pratyaahaarasutraani

Pratyaahaarasutraani or Shiva(Maheshwara) Sutrani are the same thing.
Shiva(Maheshwara) Sutrani ([ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B6-u8c7Xp8)):
> # `अइउण् ऋऌक् एओङ् ऐऔच् हयवरट् लण् ञमङणनम् झभञ् घढधष् जबगडदश् खफछठथचटतव् कपय् शषसर् हल्`

अच् pratyaahaarasutra are all vowels, and हल्(first string) are all consonants (plus an अ kaaraa)

as we can see, if the rule to form a pratyaahaara is to start with any letter in the Shivasutra and end at any itti, then we can build so many such pratyaahaaras (how many exactly?), but only 42 of them are important. ([ref](https://ashtadhyayi.com/pratyahara/))

we begin the study of Ashtadhyayi now.

# 1.1.1 वृद्धिरादैच्
(definition) The letters आ, ऐ and औ are called 'वृद्धि'.

वृद्धिर् + आद् + ऐच् = वृद्धिः + आत् + ऐच्

आत् means the long आ and not the short अ.

blinking is taken to be the unit of time called "maatraa".
short (laghu or hrashva) is of 1 maatraa and long (dirgha) is of 2 maatraas.
vowels are two and consonants are of half maatraa.
there exist 3 maatraas too! it's used to address a person.

त् kaaraa after the letter indicates what to take long or short, it's long in our case.
it also matters what follows त् kaaraa. in our case it's long ऐच् = ऐ and औ from the 4th Shivasutra, though we don't have long and short versions of ऐ and औ!

the definition of वृद्धिः not only includes आ, ऐ and औ, that are drawn from the alphabets(varnmaalaa) but also those आ, ऐ and औ, that are built from conjuctions, e.g. अ + ए = ऎ.


# 1.1.2 अदेङ्गुणः
(definition) The letters अ, ए and ओ are called 'गुण'.

अद् + एङ् + गुणः = अत् + एङ् + गुणः

from the 3rd shivasutra एङ् = ए and ओ.


# 1.1.3 इको गुणवृद्धी
(interpretation) If the words गुण or वृद्धि are used to denote the operation of गुणादेश or वृद्धि-आदेश without specifying where such an आदेश happens, then this आदेश should be done in place of the 'इक्' letter.

इकः + गुण-वृद्धी

इक् is a pratyaahaara from shivasutra which stands for इ, उ, ऋ, and ऌ.

the old letter is called "sthaani" and the new letter is called "aadesha".


# 1.1.4 न धातुलोप आर्धधातुके
If a part of धातु gets removed due to an आर्धधातुक प्रत्यय, then that प्रत्यय cannot cause any गुण or वृद्धि on the remaining part of that धातु.
