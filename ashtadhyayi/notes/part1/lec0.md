मुनित्रयं नमस्कृत्य ([ref](https://www.wisdomlib.org/definition/munitraya))

मुनिॆॆत्रय (three great munis, three prominent grammarians of the Paninian system of grammar) 
- पाणिनि
- कात्यायन
- पतंजलि
 
Panini or Dakshiputra's birthplace is approximated to be Gandhar. his name is known in various forms, e.g panini, panina, panineya, dakshiputra, paniputra etc..

two of his disciples wrote complemetary sutras.

Patanjali has commented on his work, "no single letter/sutra is redundant in ashtadhyayi".

He also wrote Varttikka, on techniques of pronunciation of letters, which is one of the dicipline of Vedangas, and Sulbasutras.

Katyayana or Vararuchi was a diciple of him, without his Varttikka it's difficult to understand ashtadhyayi. infact ashtadhyayi is incomplete without it.
it's got five characteristics:
- padachchheda (conjuction of padas, sandhi vichchhed)
- padardhokti (meaning of the words)
- vigrah (central meaning of a sentence)
- vaakyayojana
- purvapaksha-samadhana (opossition or negation of a theory)

if there's any conflicts between the three, the one whose argument is to be taken to be true is the next one (in the order above).

How is Grammar eminated?
it's not eminated as a commendments without records to the popular usage.
grammarians have seperated asaadhu and saadhu padas, that is grammatically incorrect and correct words.

grammar is an essential body of a language, and we should not neglect it.
the definition of grammar can be put like, "that which helps creating new words".

entire creation is a mixture of prakruti and purush(pratyaya, vikruti). that is a conjunction of the feminine and masculine existence.

patanjali wrote in his commentary that grammar is important for the protection of veda(wisdom).

Ashtadhyayi is collection of 8(ashta) chapters(adhyaaya)/books, each chapter contains 4 padas(sections/chapters), and about 4000 sutras(aphorisms, though it donesn't richly translate).

sutrayati/suchayati iti sutram, meaning, that which indicates/describes/produces by binding together as a string.

all the ancient shastras are written in sutras. characteristics of sutras are:
- alpaaksharam (as few words as possible)
- asandigdham (non ambiguous)
- saaravat (having quintessence or originality)
- vishyatomukham (make us understand it in different features)
- ashtobham (irresistible meaning)
- anvadyench (spotless)

the first chapter of first book contains 74 sutras, and 53 are discussed here, remaining will be discussed later.

there are 6 various types ([ref](https://www.learnsanskrit.org/panini/structure/)) of sutras(in concrete to abstract order):
- Samgnya (Definition)
- Vidhi (general method or rule)
- Niyam (exception or contradiction of the previous vidhi)
- Atidesh (copying the properties of another, sort of like Objects of Classess share the same property with extra local information)
- Adhikaar (specification of what follows)
    - Anuvrutti (range of Adhikaar)
- Paribhaasa (statement about interpretation of other rules)
