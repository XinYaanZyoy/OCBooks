- week1: Rapid overview of Fortran programming Language
    - there was nothing to be learnt for me in this week! it's just basic recapse of fortran 90/95.
- week2: Random Number generation and testing
    - [LEC1: 1D grid method](/OCBooks/COMPHY/notes/week2/lec1)
    - [LEC2: 2D and nD grid method](/OCBooks/COMPHY/notes/week2/lec2)
    - [LEC3: Monte Carlo method](/OCBooks/COMPHY/notes/week2/lec3)
    - [LEC4: random numbers](/OCBooks/COMPHY/notes/week2/lec4)
    - LEC5: in ForTran, simple!
